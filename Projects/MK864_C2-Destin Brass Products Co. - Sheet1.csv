Assignment : Destin Brass Products Case Prep D2,,,,,,,,
Assignment Objective,Calculate and Compare four different ways to look at costs for cost-plus pricing,,,,,,,
"Do costing for 4 methods, all identified in the case:

1. Standard Cost Accounting
2. Revised Standard Cost Accounting
3. Activity-Based Costing, and
4. Contribution-Margin Accounting (see Alfordâ€™s comments on case p. 4).
Which method is right for pricing? Why?",,,,,,,,

Note : We have considered variable cost as from Exhibit 4 Revised Unit Costs,,,,,,,,
"However, variable cost are volume dependent, & material + material overhead + set-up labor + direct labor + Other overhead cost can be considered as variable cost, which is ""Revised Standard Cost"" in Exhibit 4",,,,,,,,
"$541,165 is required to cover the fixed costs after considering variable costs.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Also Flow Controllers appears to have maximum contribution, might be one of the important product for overall profit",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Which method is right for pricing? Why?,,,,,,,,
Combination of Activity Based Costing & Contribution Margin Method is considered to be right for pricing,,,,,,,,
"1. The incorporation of material overhead and machine-hour basis overheads at different rates (48% and $42.59 respectively) makes this method potentially more accurate than the standard costing method.

2. 3rd Method: Activity-Based Costing (ABC), the total unit costs calculated are $25.257, $36.3712, and $95.54 for valves, pumps, and flow controllers, respectively. Also we can see that flow controllers incur a significantly higher overhead cost per unit ($66.66) compared to other two. Since this method has higher accuracy and has potential to provide cost allocation with good accuracy, and could be good for actual cost structures.

3. Contribution Margin Accounting - per unit has been calculated as $8.78, $22.31, and $49.11 for valves, pumps, and flow controllers, respectively. Total Margin as $541165.
This method provides clear view of profitabililty of the products, having flow controllers as highest $49.11 - might be most profitable products.
Therefore, we can set prices strategically to maximize the overall contribution margin.",,,,,,,,
"Therefore, a combination of the ABC method to understand the cost structure and contribution margin method, on maximizing profitability - appears to be the best approach. Thus can potentially increase the overall profitability.",,,,,,,,
