1. Competition based,"This approach may make EcoBus competitive in terms of price, but it leaves a significant amount of money on the table because it doesn’t account for the additional value that EcoBus offers compared to traditional diesel buses.",,,,,,
2. Cost Plus Pricing ,"This approach ensures that all costs are covered and a profit margin is secured. However, it also may not capture the full value that EcoBus provides to customers, leading to less potential revenue compared to EVE pricing.",,,,,,
3. EVE,This approach aims to price the product based on the economic value it delivers to customers.,,,,,,
,"It could potentially maximize revenue but might also face challenges in convincing customers about the perceived value, especially if it leads to a significantly higher price.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Judging the Usefulness of Different Approaches,,,,,,,
"Competition-Based Pricing: This is straightforward and ensures the product is priced competitively in the market. However, it doesn't consider the added value and differentiating factors of the product.",,,,,,,
"Status Quo/Cost-Plus Pricing: This ensures that the cost of production is covered with a profit margin. But it can sometimes result in prices that are either too high or too low, not reflecting the actual value of the product to customers.",,,,,,,
"Economic Value-Based Pricing (EVE): This approach aims to price the product based on its perceived value to customers. While it can maximize revenue, it's often challenging to quantify all elements of value, and it requires convincing the customer of this perceived value.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Considering CM for money left on the table,,,,,,,
1. Competition-Based Pricing:,,,,,,,
CM = Selling Price (Competition-Based) - Cost of Production,,,,,,,
Total Contribution from Competition-Based Pricing = CM * Projected Sales Volume for 3 years,,,,,,,
Selling Price,"480,000",,,,,,
CM = Selling Price (Competition-Based) - Cost of Production,-17000,,,,,,
minus - this means the competition based price doesnot cover the production cost,,,,,,,
Total Contribution for 3 years ,-104720000,,,,,,

,,,,,,,
2. Cost Plus Pricing,,,,,,,
Selling Price,"$571,550.00",,,,,,

Total Contribution for 3 years,"$459,228,000.00",,,,,,

3. EVE,,,,,,,
Selling Price,"$891,112.00",,,,,,
CM,"$394,112.00",,,,,,
Total Contribution for 3 years,"$2,427,729,920.00",,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Money Left on the table,,,,,"Competition-Based: $433,523,200 - (-$18,700,000) = $452,223,200",,
For Competition-Based Pricing,"$2,532,449,920.00",,,,"Cost Plus: $433,523,200 - $96,476,468.80 = $337,046,731.20",,
For Cost-Plus Pricing,"$1,968,501,920.00",,,,,,
,,,,,,,
The above calculation shows - the competition based pricing leaves a significant amount of money on the table,,,,,,,
The cost based pricing captures more value but still doesnt maximizes the potential value as the EVE does over the projected sales volume of 3 years,,,,,,,

Analysis,,,,,,,
1. Competition Based Analysis,,,,,,,
"This approach is simple and ensures that the price is competitive in the market. However, it does not consider the additional value provided by the EcoBus, leading to a significant amount of money left on the table.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
2. Cost-Plus Pricing,,,,,,,
"This method ensures that all costs are covered, and a profit margin is secured. ",,,,,,,
"However, it may not fully capture the value that EcoBus provides to the customers.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
3. EVE Pricing,,,,,,,
This strategy aims to price the product based on the economic value it delivers to the customer. ,,,,,,,
It is the most advantageous as it captures the maximum value while justifying the price to the customer.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Conclusion,,,,,,,
Adopting competition-based or cost-plus pricing would lead to a loss of potential revenue.,,,,,,,
"EVE pricing, while complex, ensures that the price is set in correlation with the value delivered, maximizing revenue.",,,,,,,
"The firm could potentially leave over a billion dollars on the table with competition-based pricing, ",,,,,,,
"and nearly 300 million with cost-plus, highlighting the financial advantage of adopting a value-based pricing strategy.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
5. Recommend a value communication strategy for this new product and pricing strategy. ,,,,,,,
What approaches to value framing could support EcoBus’ positioning with customers and why?,,,,,,,
How should ZeeTrans use the value communication tools we learned in class to communicate value to customers?,,,,,,,
How will your recommendations address sales force concerns and customers’ concerns? Be specific.,,,,,,,
