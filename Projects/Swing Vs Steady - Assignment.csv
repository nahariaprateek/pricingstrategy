Use the simple concept of contribution to calculate just the change in profits due to the proposed price changes.,,,,,,,,,,
Both have equal 50%-50% market share,,,,,,,,,,
Note : Both the units are same initially for swing and steady,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,

achieving a 20% and a 40% increase in sales?",,,,,,,,,

"Both Companies should pursue this opportunity, Swing has additional potential profit, may find it compelling to enter the low- level segment.",,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
B.,,,,,,,,,,
Problem Statement: ,"In fact, neither Swing nor Steady can effectively segment this market (each must charge one price to
everyone). Calculate the break-even sales changes for this opportunity for each of them. Calculate the
changes in profit for a 40% increase in sales. Briefly explain why this answer differs from your answer in
part a.",,,,,,,,,
Calculate the break even sales changes for this opportunity for each of them,,,,,,,,,,
Calculate the changes in profit for 40% increase in sales,,,,,,,,,,
Write why this answer differs from A.,,,,,,,,,,

Notes from the class:,,,,,,,,,,
% BE Sales Change = -Price Change/CM +- Price Change,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Unit BE Sales Change = % BE Sales Change * Initial Sales Volume,,,,,,,,,,

"For Swing, the price change from 10 to 8.5 led to increase in sales vol and same revenue, BE Sales Change is 1250 units.
Which means 1250 units are the additional sales need to cover the loss in revenue per unit due to price reduction.

The calculation reflects, net increase in 750 units and above to reach the break even point or cross it.

We can now say that, the 40% increase in sales would result in additional profitability for Swing Manufacturers.",,,,,,"Here for Steady Manufacturer, we can say that 40% increment in the sales volume wont be sufficient enough to cover the BE Sales Change (i.e negative 1500).",,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
"We can say that, part b provides a more accurate reflection, condering Break Even Sales Change Units which wasnt in Part A & both the parts differs as in because of the new pricing.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
C.,,,,,,,,,,
Problem Statement,Which competitor is better positioned to take advantage of this opportunity? Assuming,,,,,,,,,
,"that neither company can segment the market, what advice would you give to Swing and",,,,,,,,,
,to Steady regarding this opportunity?,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,Swing  Vs Steady Manufacturing,,,,,,,,,
a.,Swing Manufacturing is better positioned to take advantage of this opportunity.,,,,,,,,,
,High CM $ i.e 7.5 compared to Steady which is $4.5.,,,,,,,,,
,Considering New CM of $ 6 post price reduction from $10 to $ 8.5 swing is at better position and has more margin & even with BE Sales Units swing has +ve additional profit of $4500,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
b.,Advice referenced below,,,,,,,,,
,Advice,,,,,,,,,
,Swing,,,Steady,,,,,,
,"Swing should persue the opportunity having +ve additional profit even after the price reduction and also seek opportunities to maintain or improve the Contribution Margin by reducing variable cost, and adding more value .
Swing can afford to lose sales when they reduce the price",,,"It is not advised to enter market at this point of time for Steady manufacturers.
The -ve additional profit indicates that price reduction to $8.5 may be not be right option, unitl should boost sales above 40%.
Should seek options to improve contributional margin.
Should seek for strategies, which would reduce the variable cost.
Should opt for alternative strategies to be in the market, such as improving product quality, customer service or other market segments",,,,,,

D.,,,,,,,,,,
Problem Statement,Was Steady's decision to cut price financially justified?,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1,Considering Price Cut,,,,,,,,,
,% BESC,-0.3333333333,-33.33%,Price Change / CM = -1.5/4.5,,OR (with 5.5 Margin),-0.2727272727,-1.5/5.5,,
,,,,,,,-27.27%,,,
,"Steady would lose 33.33% , despite of 60% ",,,,,,,,,
,"It can be said that, lowering price or having a price cut would significantly better than not cutting of price and bearing 60% loss in sales.",,,,,,,,,
,Clearly 33% lose is better than 60% loss (No Price Cut),,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1.1,Also Price Cut,,,,,,,,,
,Price Change,-1.5,,,,,,,,
,Variable Cost,5.5,,,,,,,,
,Total Revenue,42500,8.5*5000,,,,,,,
,Units,5000,,,,,,,,
,Unit Price,8.5,,,,,,,,
,1.1CM,3,,,,,,,,
,Total Revenue,42500,,,,,,,,
,Total Variable Cost,27500,,,,,,,,
,Fixed Cost,20000,,,,,,,,
,P/L,-5000,Loss of 5000,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
2,Net Lose Sales,60%,,Keeping $10 and no price change,,,,,,
,Remaining,40%,,,,,,,,
,Units Sold,2000,,,,,,,,
,Unit Price,10,,,,,,,,
,Total Revenue,20000,,,,,,,,
,Total Variable Cost,11000,,,,,,,,
,P/L,-11000,Loss of 11000,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
3,If Steady Manufacturing is thinking of withdrawing from the market ,,,,,,,,,
,Revenue ,0,,,,,,,,
,Variable Cost ,0,,,,,,,,
,Fixed Cost,10000,reduced by half as mentioned in the case,,,,,,,
,P/L,-10000,"Loss of 10,000",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Recommendation,Steady Manufacturing's cutting price financially seems to be justified,,,,,,,,,
,Bearing a loss of 5000 is better than bearing 11000 loss,,,,,,,,,
,But if they can sell more than 7500 units that is their BESP,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
E.,,,,,,,,,,
Problem Statement,"Given the financial information that you have at this point, would Steady be better off to withdraw from this",,,,,,,,,
,market altogether?,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
"Considering above calculation and information, the assumption that Steady's sales would increase if they lowered their price, they will not be better off if they withdraw.",,,,,,,,,,
"However considering the case where Steady is cutting off sales, it is advised to withdraw, as calculated above in D that profit losses will be greater if they withdraw from this market altogether.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Scenarios could be ,,,,,,,,,,
a. Maintaining Price to $10,,,,,,,,,,
b. Cutting Price to $8.5,,,,,,,,,,
c. Withdrawing from market,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
We can laydown all 3 scenarios in a single matrix,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,Withdraw,Price Cut,Same Price,,,,,,,
Units,0,6000,2000,,,,,,,
Price,0,8.5,10,,,,,,,
VC/Unit,0,5.5,5.5,,,,,,,
Revenue,0,51000,20000,,,,,,,
Variable Cost,0,33000,11000,,,,,,,
Fixed Cost,10000,"20,000","20,000",,,,,,,
P/L,-10000,"-2,000","-11,000",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
"Hence, Steady Manufacturing will not be in better off if they withdraw from this market altogether.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
F.,,,,,,,,,,
Problem Statement,"What is the minimum monthly unit sales that Steady would require to make it more profitable as aspecialty widget manufacturer than it is currently as a commodity manufacturer?",,,,,,,,,
Hint: ,"Please assume that Steady is now operating at a baseline of $8.50 (which they decided
to do in Question D), not the baseline of $10.00 assumed in Questions A and B earlier.",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Please consider Scenario 1 only as answer for the F. ,,,,,,,,,,
Scenario 1 : Old Price = $8.5,,,,,,,,,,

Now add Incremental fixed cost over the new contribution margin to initial BESCP ,,,,,,,,,,
i.e BESCP + FC/CM(new),,,,,,,,,,
Lets call this BE w/IFC be y,,,,,,,,,,
y,3800,,,,,,,,,
Steady Manufacturing should sell atleast 3800 units to be more profitable as specialty widget.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
"Also Checking it with the old price $10, to be not considered in answer the scenario 2 ",,,,,,,,,,
Scenario 2 : Old Price = $10,,,,,,,,,,

Now add Incremental fixed cost over the new contribution margin to initial BESCP ,,,,,,,,,,
i.e BESCP + FC/CM(new),,,,,,,,,,
Lets call this BE w/IFC be y,,,,,,,,,,
y,3257,,,,,,,,,
Steady Manufacturing should sell atleast 3257 units to be more profitable as specialty widget.,,,,,,,,,,
